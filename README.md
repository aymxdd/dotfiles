# @aymxdd dotfiles

This repository contains my personal config for nvim and tmux.

## Installation (Linux only for now)

To install the dotfiles, run the following command:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aymxdd/dotfiles/main/install.sh)"
```

**CAUTION:** This will overwrite your current config files. Make sure to backup your current config files before running the installation script.
